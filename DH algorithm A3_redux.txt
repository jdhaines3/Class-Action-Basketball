Algorithm for Class Madness
David Haines

Goal: To create a replayable game in which two players (of same skill) take turns shooting a basketball.
If one player makes the shot while the other misses, the player that missed earns a letter. The game continues
until one player spells out HORSE.  After the game is complete, the user will have the option to replay a game.

Files:
	-C++ needs header file for player, a player class file, and a game file.
	-Java needs a player class and game class.
	
Output:
	-Players will take shots and print the results until one makes it while the other misses.
		-once this happens, print what letter the player who missed the shot earned.
	-continue printing like this until one player has the letters for HORSE
	-print the winner and loser
	-Ask user if want to replay
	
Detailed Overview:
	Player class:
		-needs constructor and destructor
		-needs attributes of name, hit chance, shot, and the Char string for Horse
			-name will be public and just created when instance called, will be set to NULL
			-hit chance will take the random number generated from the game class and store it for a method
				to determine if player makes the shot
			-the shot attribute will be a string that says "hit" or "missed"
			-the char string will be 6 chars max, and already store A,H,O,R,S, and E.
				-A is stored in array[0] as a placeholder. the index pointer starts at 0, when the player gets a letter, it is incremented
					this way, the first incrememnt will be pointing to H
				-a pointer will be used as an index to this array
		
		-needs a method to determine if hit chance number will make the shot.
			-if hitchance is between 1 and 50, the player misses the shot.
				-the shot variable will be changed to "MISSED"
			-if hitchance between 51 and 100, player hits shot
				-shot variable changed to "HIT"
			-else error
			
		-needs a method to print the result
			-uses name and shot variables
			
		-needs a method that increments the char array pointer by one if player gets a letter
		
		-in C++, needs header file that declares methods and attributes
		
	
	Game class:
		-needs to import class/header file
		-needs random import
		
		-global variable keepGoing and char array size of 1 for continue while loop
		
		-call random seed
		
		-start while loop (for replay question at end)
			-create 2 instances of player class, evrything set to zero/Null
				-name one instance player 1 and other player 2
		
		-start new while loop, while value at ptrIndex of player 1 is <5 AND ptrIndex of player 2 is <5, continue
			-this while loop constitutes a round of shots
			
			-set rand1 and rand2
			-set p1 hitchance to rand1 and same for p2 (rand2)
			
			-both players call make shot method
			
			-both players print shot method
				-make shot and print shot split up in order to make debugging easier
			
			-if statement: 
				-if p1 hits shot but p2 misses: p1 increment ptr function
				-elif p2 hits shot but p1 misses: p2 increment ptr function
				-else pass
				
			-while loop for continue question
				-ask user if want to continue
				if y, exit continue while loop and delete instances
				if n, exite continue loop and round while loop, as well as delete player instances
				else print that the input wasn't valid
